At the end of this year, Bernard Lagat, one of America’s premier runners, will take a break from his rigorous training. For five weeks, he will put away his running shoes and significantly reduce his exercise. This practice, far from being a recent development or a concession to age for the 43-year-old athlete, has been a cornerstone of his regimen since 1999. Lagat credits these breaks with helping him stay at the top of his game in international running, having competed in five Olympics and secured two world championships.

While Lagat’s annual break might be the most extensive, many elite runners follow similar patterns, taking time off ranging from ten days to five weeks. Leo Manzano, an Olympic silver medalist in the 1500 meters, shared with the Wall Street Journal that he also needs at least a month off to recover from the season, noting, 

> **"It feels like I’ve been going nonstop since November."**

Consider your own situation: Have you ever felt exhausted like Manzano? Did you take a full month off, or even just a weekend? For many Americans, the answer is no. We often work through weekends and fail to use all of our paid time off, let alone take extended vacations. This approach stems from a long-standing belief that constant hard work is essential to avoid falling behind. We often encounter motivational sayings like, 

> **"When you’re not practicing, someone else is, and they’ll win if you meet them."**

This mindset often equates hard work with simply doing more work, rather than working smarter.

The problem with never allowing for “easy” periods is that it impedes our ability to fully engage during “hard” periods. Instead, we end up in a monotonous routine—neither truly exerting ourselves nor allowing for adequate rest. This cycle, often referred to as "going through the motions," hinders growth. To achieve peak performance over time without burning out, we need to follow Lagat’s example and incorporate substantial rest periods. Lagat not only takes a significant break at the end of each year but also observes a rest day at the end of every intense training week. On these days, he avoids running and instead participates in relaxing activities such as receiving massages, light stretching, watching TV, enjoying wine, and spending time with his family.

We are not suggesting that you take breaks indiscriminately. Instead, like Lagat, we recommend strategically planning longer rest periods to follow intense phases of work. The structure of the modern workweek was originally based on this principle, with weekends designed to provide rest similar to the Sabbath. However, many people continue working through weekends or face additional stresses, missing out on needed rest.

Failing to rest on weekends can degrade the quality of our work during the week, leading to a cycle of insufficient stress and inadequate recovery. To break this cycle, start by ensuring you take at least one full day off this weekend, disconnecting from work and related stressors. Research shows that taking time off can significantly boost vigor and performance, and the more you rest on weekends, the more productive you can be during the week. If taking a break seems challenging, use this book to discuss with your employer the importance of rest for optimal performance.

During the writing of this book, they made it a point to take at least one day off each week, avoiding any writing or research on that day. Our most productive writing days consistently followed these rest days, often occurring the next day or two. Some individuals recover quickly from breaks, while others take more time. Identifying which category you fall into can help you schedule breaks more effectively, ensuring they are as beneficial as possible.

While short rest days are essential, sometimes longer breaks are necessary for full recovery. Just as regular rest days should follow periods of stress, vacations should be planned after extended periods of intense work. Lagat’s five-week break occurs not during the season but after his final race of the year, when he is most in need of recovery. For musicians, this might involve taking a break after a tour or completing a record. For visual and material artists, it could mean resting after a gallery opening or finishing a challenging work. For intellectuals and business professionals, it might mean scheduling breaks after completing significant projects or deals.

While various factors, such as family obligations or workplace policies, can complicate scheduling extended vacations, planning these breaks thoughtfully is important. Research indicates that vacations lasting 7 to 10 days can enhance motivation, well-being, and health for up to a month, and a week-long break can significantly reduce burnout. However, if the underlying causes of burnout are not addressed, symptoms may resurface soon after.

This insight underscores that extended breaks should not be viewed as a cure-all for unsustainable workloads. Instead, they should be part of a broader rest strategy that includes mini-breaks, quality sleep, and off-days. Vacations, rather than being the ultimate solution, are the icing on the cake—providing a chance to fully recover after accumulated stress and return stronger. Lagat’s approach ensures that while he finishes the season tired, he is not defeated. Fatigue can stimulate growth, while being broken represents a more serious issue.
